				<div id="p1"><p>Ken Kaneki (Kaneki Ken) is the protagonist of Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul:re.
							Formerly, he was a human studying Japanese Literature at Kamii University and living a normal life. 
							However, everything soon changed after he had Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou transplanted into him and became a One-Eyed Ghoul.
							 After joining Anteiku as a part-time waiter, he learns how to live as a Ghoul and became known as Eyepatch (Gantai).</p>
						<p>After being captured by Aogiri Tree, he was able to accept his ghoul side, forming a team with the goal of protecting 
								the ones precious to him and "plucking out" people who threaten the place he belongs to. Because of his Kakuja's distinct appearance, 
								the CCG gave him the nickname Centipede (Mukade).</p>
						<p>He is currently living under the identity of Haise Sasaki (Sasaki Haise), as a First Class Ghoul Investigator, 
								serving as the mentor of the CCG's Quinx Squad and a member of Team Mado. His memories are lost to him, yet he is slowly beginning to understand 
								what his past self was like through those that knew Ken Kaneki, such as Hinami Fueguchi.</p>

								but moments before eating him, she was injured in an accident and her organs were transplanted into Kaneki, making him half-ghoul.</p>
						<p>Rize is also known under her nickname Binge Eater (Binge Eater or Gluttony, literally Big Eater). Because of her eating habits, 
								Rize was a threat to most ghouls of the 11th ward and 20th ward.</p>
						<p>It has been revealed that her name may be fake by Itori.
								Her relation with Matasaka Kamishiro is unclear.</p>
